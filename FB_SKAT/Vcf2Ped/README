Vcf2TrioGenotype - Utility to prepare the pedigree file suitable for FB-SCAT and scan_trios
programs

Source code: Vcf2TrioGenotype.py

Sample Vcf: Two 1000 Genomes Trios (CEU and YRI) were downloaded from
            ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/pilot_data/paper_data_sets/a_map_of_human_variation/trio/
            merged and annotated with Anntools.
            Ten thousand lines are given as a sample VCF for you to practice.
            
Purpose:  1. Creates GT (genotype) file based on the VCF and PED files provided
          for each trio listed in PED file
          2. Generates VARIANT file based on annotated VCF provided. By default, the snpEff/GATK
          annotation is expected, but can be configured to use other annotator. See CONFIGURATION SECTION
          for details
          3. Generated gene index file, i.e. start and end position of gene in the VCF file. Both positions are inclusive and start with one.


Input:  1. Formatted and sorted variant call format (VCF) file. (http://www.1000genomes.org/wiki/Analysis/Variant%20Call%20Format/vcf-variant-call-format-version-41)
            Use VCFTools (http://vcftools.sourceforge.net/) for format verification if in doubt
            VCF file may be compressed.

        2. PED file. Must have the following columns IN THAT PARTICULAR ORDER:
             FamilyID (0=unknown)
             IndividualID (Must include all in the VCF file)
             PaternalID (0=unknown)
             MaternalID (0=unknown)
             Sex (1=male; 2=female; 0=unknown)
             Phenotype (1=control/unaffected, 2=case/affected, 0=unknown)

            PED format is described at http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/data.shtml#ped
        3. Base (no extension) of the output file
        
        4. True for PASS only, False for All variants
        
        5. True for minus 1 from Phenotype, as required by FB-SKAT

Output: For each complete trio (child, father and mother ID present in both PED and VCF files),
program outputs one row, where columns are:
FamilyID, IndividualID, PaternalID, MaternalID, Sex, Phenotype, followed by Genotype1....GenotupeN
First six columns are drawn from the PED file, the genotypes are drawn from matching samples
at VCF file.

Genotypes are coded as 0, 1 or 2 (no mutation, heterozygous, homozygous respectively)

Note! Families with more than one child are treated as 2 or more trios.

Dependencies:
Python 2.6 or higher. No special libraries are needed

Installation:
No installation is needed. Copy the script to any directory at your computer and give it 755 permission

To run:

python Vcf2TrioGenotype.py vcf ped output True/False
